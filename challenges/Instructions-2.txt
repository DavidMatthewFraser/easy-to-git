Welcome to Challenge #2!

It's time to have some fun :)

Description: The page you just came from is our Open-Source Solar System.
In this challenge, you will add your own 'space object' 
to the solar system and give it an animation using Animate.css.

Steps:

1. Find an image of a spaceship, planet, star, Ufo, etc ... 
(Make sure the image has a transparent background color)

2. Add an <img> tag under <div id='solar-system'></div> and link to the image you found with the src attribute

4. Give your image a unique id, ex: id='davids_planet'

5. Modify your image's position in  challenge2.css by targeting your unique id

(Note: use position: absolute)

6. Animate.css is already imported, apply an animation by giving your

image class='animated bounce' (you can replace bounce with any animations found on

https://animate.style/ such as flash, pulse, shake and so on)

7. (optional) Feel free to add any custom javascript to assets/js/challenge2.js

8. Make a merge request with your changes

- Good Job, You've added a space object to our Open_Source Solar System!

(Note: Don't be afraid to make mistakes or ask questions)
