# Hello and Welcome
## It should be a fun time doing the codez with all yall!
### You can check out tutorials such as <a href='https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions/blob/master/README.md'>this one</a> to get famaliar with the git hubz


# Easy to git
The idea of this repo is to get you started with git and GitHub.

## The very basics
git and GitHub are different tools but work together. git is a program you run on your machine. And you use git to make and get changes to code stored on GitHub. GitHub is a remote host of files, that you work on with other people.

### So can you repeat, how are those different?
Because GitHub is on a different computer, when we create our remote repository, we set permissions for people to see the code, make copies or "fork" it, and "push" our changes to it.
So the remote repository automatically becomes a collaboration tool. While git controls the project, we need a remote repository to collaborate, and that is GitHub.

## Steps to collaborate on this repo
Basically you make a copy of this repository in your own GitHub account, add whatever changes you want, and then ask the person who created the repo to accept your changes by making a "pull request". That's how it works if the repo isn't yours. If you want to make your own changes and you don't want to change the original repo, you can work on your own fork.
* Fork the repository (first you need to create a GitHub account)
* Clone it from your fork to your local storage (`git clone https://github.com/yourUserHere/easy-to-git`)
* Push to your repository on GitHub.
* Log into GitHub and when you're ready, make a pull request. (Or do a pull request from your local machine?)   Do we even need to fork first??

## What changes do we expect in the files?
Here we'll add some examples...
- add your name to the contributers.md file
- add your github name to the ``` contributors array ``` in the contributorsPanel.js 
- add an html element, for example: ``` <h1>Open Source Rules</h1> ```
- add some js, for example: ```logHello()```

# What next?
TBH .... idk, maybe you can tell me ...
We definitely need a better ReadMe lol 😝
